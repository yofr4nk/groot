## Introduction

I am using the books "Writing An Interpreter In Go" and "Writing a Compiler" to learn how to build an interpreter and
a compiler for a simple programming language using Go. The books are a great resource for learning about the 
fundamentals of programming language design and implementation.

This repository contains the code examples and exercises from both books, along with additional resources to help me 
understand the concepts covered in the books.

## Interpreter

The first book, "Writing An Interpreter In Go" teaches how to build an interpreter for a simple programming 
language called Monkey. The interpreter is implemented in Go and supports features like variables, control structures, 
functions, and closures.

In this repository, I will find the code examples from the book, along with additional exercises to help me solidify 
my understanding of the interpreter concepts.

## Compiler

The second book, "Writing a Compiler" teaches how to build a compiler for the Monkey programming language. 
The compiler takes Monkey source code and generates executable code that can be run on a machine.

In this repository, I will find the code examples from the book, along with additional exercises to help me solidify 
my understanding about the compiler concepts.
